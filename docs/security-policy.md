## Security

Nitehub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our Nitehub organizations, such as [Nitehub](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/nitehub).

Even though open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug security program, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation. 

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Nitehub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public Nitehub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to [technical.nitely@gmail.com](mailto:technical.nitely@gmail.com).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
