# Introduction

Thank you for using Nitely!

Nitehub is an open source software hosting platform.

Nitehub is maintained by the [Nitehub Org](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/nitehub).

As Nitehub, we're committed to
building communities that are welcoming and inclusive: environments where people
are encouraged to share ideas, treat each other with respect, and collaborate
towards the best solutions. To reinforce our commitment, Nitehub
has adopted a slightly modified [Code of Conduct](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/nitehub/.nitehub/src/branch/main/docs/code_of_conduct.md)
for the Nitehub project.

**NB:** _Contributions to this project are released to the public under the project's open source license._

# <a name="reporting-bugs"></a>Reporting bugs

Reports of flaws in Nitehub, including software bugs, errors
in the documentation, missing files in the tarball, suggested changes
or requests for new apps, etc., can be filed using Nitehub issues for the prior repository.

Due to a large ticket backlog, we are sometimes slow to respond,
especially if a bug is cosmetic or if a suggestion is vague or
low in priority, but we try at least to acknowledge legitimate
bug reports within a week.

Nitehub's issue system is publicly readable; however, you must have
an account to create a new issue.

## Reporting possible security issues

If you think you may be seeing a potential security vulnerability in Nitehub, please
report it immediately opening an [issue](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/nitehub/.nitehub/issues/) with the `Security Vulnerability` label. 

Do not discuss undisclosed security vulnerabilities on any public mailing list.
We as Nitehub have a long history of handling reported vulnerabilities promptly and
effectively on many projects and we respect and acknowledge responsible reporters.

Our [Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://git.c-eo.repl.co/nitehub/.nitehub/src/branch/main/docs/security-policy) is documented on Nitehub.
