Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images on any media, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors and speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors and speakers may not use sexualized images, activities, or other material during their talks or any media in relation to the conference. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from any private, online conference platforms.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference platforms.
